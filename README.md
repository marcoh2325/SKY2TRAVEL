The objective of this project was to build a chatbot using NLP.
The chatbot will be used to automate the task of purchasing tickets from an airline. The customer will be able to speak to the chatbot, and it should understand their request.
This project was made as a task during the Master in Data Science at Assembler Institute of Technology.
